# TCRD / Pharos Pipeline TODO

Two-stage tracker: (1) get data into the Pharos ArangoDB graph, (2) convert it to the TCRD MySQL schema.
Status: [ ] not started | [~] in progress | [x] done

---

## Code Style TODOs

- [ ] `ProteinAdapter` (UniProt) yields `Pathway` nodes and `ProteinPathwayRelationship` edges in addition to `Protein` — consider splitting into separate adapters to make intent clear
- [ ] Normalize old `pharos_mysql` adapters to use `EquivalentId(...).id_str()` consistently instead of manual `f"{Prefix...}:{...}"` string construction where they emit graph IDs.

## POUNCE Code Style TODOs

- [ ] Replace `CategoryValue` with `Dict[str, str]` — `CategoryValue` is a dataclass with only `name` and `value` fields (plus an `id` derived from them), used wherever a category label + value pair is stored (e.g. `demographics.categories`, `exposure.category`, `biospecimen.organism_category`). Plain dicts would be simpler, eliminate the class entirely, and map naturally to the `dict_table` pattern in `arango_to_mysql.py` (which already handles `Dict[str, str]` fields as linked key-value tables in MySQL).

## Pipeline Status Table

Each row is a protein-facing Pharos/TCRD concept. Data source checkboxes = ingested into the Pharos graph or side-lifted into the protein-oriented Pharos view. MySQL table checkboxes = outputs written during the TCRD build, whether graph-derived or loaded directly from source files.

### Source-File Ontology Tables

These tables are populated directly from ontology source files during the TCRD build, not reconstructed from the merged graph disease hierarchy.

| Source Concept | Source Files | TCRD Tables |
|---------|------------------------|-------------|
| **MONDO ontology** | [x] `input_files/auto/mondo/mondo.json` | [x] `mondo`<br>[x] `mondo_xref`<br>[x] `mondo_parent`<br>[x] `ancestry_mondo` *(post-processing from `mondo_parent`)* |
| **Disease Ontology** | [x] `input_files/auto/disease_ontology/doid.json` | [x] `do`<br>[x] `do_parent`<br>[x] `ancestry_do` *(post-processing from `do_parent`)* |

### Larger Efforts
- Nearest Tclin (computed from graph) *(likely Reactome replacement for legacy KEGG-derived `kegg_distance` / `kegg_nearest_tclin`; see `designs/pharos/pathways/reactome_nearest_tclin_design.md`)*
- Expression Atlas *(punt for now: old TCRD used a bulk Atlas export plus custom preprocessing, but current Atlas appears to require per-experiment harvesting from FTP; revisit only as a larger dedicated project, not a quick ingest)*
- Harmonizome: pharos shows high-level summary stats for different types of data - it's basically a summary of relations in their KG, when we should probalby just use summary stats from our own KG

### Requires License
- DisGeNET Disease Associations
- KEGG Pathway
- OMIM investigation follow-up *(low priority: legacy TCRD/Pharos loaded licensed OMIM files into `omim`, `omim_ps`, and `phenotype` with `ptype='OMIM'`, and the frontend did not surface that content. Revisit only if we explicitly want a phenotype/trait ingest, not as a target-disease source.)*

### Punted / Not Doing Right Now
- maybe ClinGen - old pharos didn't have it, but maybe it's useful
- Monarch as a standalone disease-association source *(do not ingest the current dump as `Monarch`; the public file is a Translator-style aggregate whose primary sources are `infores:omim` and `infores:clingen`)*
- GWAS - gwas data is essentially duplicated in the old pharos, as it shows up in TIGA as well, and the UI exclusively uses the TIGA data, not the legacy direct GWAS data that was in there before TIGA was a thing
- NIH Target Lists - IDG lists are obsolete, grant specific lists are not useful for most people
 
### Findings From Investigation
- OMIM is not a legacy Pharos target-disease association source
  - old `load-OMIM.py` populated `omim`, `omim_ps`, and `phenotype`, not `disease`
  - `pharos319` currently has `14147` `phenotype` rows with `ptype='OMIM'`
  - the old frontend did not surface that OMIM phenotype content
- Current Monarch disease dump is not a clean standalone `Monarch` source
  - the current public file is a Translator-style aggregate
  - `infores:monarchinitiative` is the aggregator, while the primary sources are `infores:omim` and `infores:clingen`
  - do not ingest it as `Monarch`; revisit direct OMIM or direct ClinGen instead
